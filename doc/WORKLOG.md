Trying to keep some track of how this project was put together here.
The commit messages in git are used as well, but this doc should tell something about how modules and dependencies are added.

the project is generated with create-react-app

(npm install -g create-react-app && create-react-app mineablecoins)

axios is added


(cd mineablecoins && npm install --save axios)
(optional dependency fsevents was not installed because unsupported platform windows)
